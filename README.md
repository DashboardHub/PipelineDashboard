## QUICK START

1. `npm start`

Then visit `http://localhost:4200/`

### RUNNING AUTOMATED TESTS

Currently in prototype mode.

### Commit message standards

We use the Angular standards...

> We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the Angular change log https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit

The format is `<type>(<scope>): #<issue-no> <subject>`, examples...

- feat(environments): #123 delete environment
- docs(commits): #456 example commit messages
- chore(dependencies): #789 updated UI dependencies
