# Get up and running in minutes in 3 simple steps and without installing anything!

From the **DashboardHub** Team...
> Thank you for showing an interest in **DashboardHub**. We are currently in an `ALPHA` stage, your feedback would be much appreciated. Feel free to create an [Issue](https://github.com/DashboardHub/PipelineDashboard/issues) on **GitHub**

## 1. Log in with GitHub

Please log in with your GitHub account by clicking on the top right of the page.

## 2. Create a Project

Once logged click on `Add Project`. `name` and `type` are both required, other fields are optional, however we highly recommend filling them out, you can always update these later on.

Once successfully created, you will be redirected to the **Project Dashboard** page for that project.

## 3. Add repository

Click `Repositories` at the top right of the dashboard project, and a dialog will open to select your repositories that you wish to add to the project

Once you click `confirm`, you will see your project dashboard with the selected repositories *(note: it could take up to 30s to collect all the information for your repositories)*
