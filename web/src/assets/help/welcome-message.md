Welcome to DashboardHub, the no-setup, open-source platform that makes your deployment pipeline more transparent by ensuring everybody on your team is on the same page. DashboardHub does this by gathering the most up-to-date version control information (like what version is on what stage, build/deployment durations) all in one place, and monitors your deployments every 30 minutes and after each deployment to ensure everything is still up and running.

Please click the key icon on the top right to log in using your GitHub account.
