## Here's a list of key terms in *DashboardHub* and what they mean:


| Term      | What it means |
| :---      | :---          |
| **Releases**  | When you work on a piece of software, there will likely be many versions you create before you reach a version that you are ready to release to an environment (e.g. staging, production). A **release** is the final "product" that you build or deploy for a particular version. |
| **State**     | There are several possible **states** that your release might be in at any one time, depending on your environment type:![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21239137/41206045-bc490d0a-6cf5-11e8-8002-1017a40991df.png)
| Beacon    | **Beaconing** data means to tell *DashboardHub* that the state of your release has changed. For example, if the version has just started to deploy, for example, you can **beacon** this data to *DasboardHub* by running a unique, auto-generated curl `startDeploy` command.<br><br>*How do I beacon data?*<br>In DashboardHub, there are three ways you can beacon data:<br><br>1) (Recommended) Copy & paste the auto-generated curl command to the corresponding part of your automated CI config file (this is the recommended method, as this makes beaconing entirely automated<br><br>2) Run the curl command on the command line<br><br>3) Manual release form, which is a easy-to-complete dropdown form that can be found on the releases page |
| **CI**        | **CI** (Continuous Integration) Services (e.g. Travis CI, Circle CI, Gitlab CI) are scripts that could be integrated into your software build/deployment process. CI Services are automated tests that are run before changes are allowed to be integrated into the final build/deploy. If the changes fail these tests, they will not be integrated. If you place the corresponding curl commands at the correct stages of your build/deploy process in your CI config file (see above), data will be beaconed automatically to DashboardHub.
| **Monitors**  | Within your environments, you can set up **monitors**, to keep an eye on the "health" of your environment. You must have at least one monitor on an environment before you can send "pings" to it (see below). Different monitors under the same environment will be needed if you are expecting your pings to provke multiple different responses from your environment (e.g. your expected code may be `200`, `404` etc.) |
| **Pings**     | You can think of **pings** as "poking" your environment domain to see whether you get the response from the API that you expect. With DashboardHub, pings are *automatically* sent every 30 minutes from every monitor, and after every successful build/deploy. You can also *manually* send pings whenever you like. You will receive a notification whenever a ping returns as invalid. This functionality is useful in ensuring that everything is up and running as you expect, and to afford you the peace of mind that you will be notified immediately should your environment not be functioning as you expect it to. |
