# What is an environment?
An environment is a self-contained system where an entire programme or modules of an entire programme may be deployed and executed. It is common to have different environments within a phased development project, such as the Development Environment, the Staging Environment and the Production Environment.

*Note: By clicking "Add Environment", you are adding a private, not public, environment.*

# What is the difference between private and public environments?

Public environments are environments that you can access by clicking "Public Environments" in the menu. They are environments you follow, but cannot make changes to or apply monitors or send pings on.

Private environments are those that you can edit, applying monitors and send pings on.
