# How do I use a DashboardHub badge?

Badges are tag-like buttons at the top of your README.md, to showcase key features of your project (e.g. build, npm packages). They are dynamic, which means that a new button will be generated each time that feature changes (e.g. your build status has changed, or you started to use a more updated npm package), without you having to change the code in your README.md file. The buttons are also hyperlinks, so clicking on a badge would redirect you to the relevant page (e.g. the build page of your CI, or the page of the npm package version you are using).

DashboardHub auto-generates the markdown code you can directly copy & paste into your README.md. To access this, click into the relevant environment for which you want the badges.

For example
