# How do I use a DashboardHub badge?

A badge allows you to put a link in your `README.md` or any other documentation resources that link directory to your Environment Dashboardboard.

The markdown for the badge will look similar to...

```
[![DashboardHub Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DashboardHub-DashboardHub%20Test-orange.svg)](https://pipeline.dashboardhub.io/1012de50-ca3c-11e7-8e89-ddd24d528194/view)
```

And display as follows...
